# Server-Side Rendering with Flask

This project demonstrates server-side rendering (SSR) using Python and Flask. SSR is a powerful technique where web pages are generated on the server and sent to the client as fully-formed HTML, contrasting with client-side rendering where JavaScript in the browser dynamically builds the page. Through this project, you'll learn how to implement SSR with Flask, leveraging the Jinja templating engine to create dynamic, efficient, and SEO-friendly web applications.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the concepts of server-side rendering and how it differs from client-side rendering.
- Learn the benefits of SSR in web development.
- Implement SSR in Python using the Flask framework.
- Utilize the Jinja templating engine to dynamically generate HTML pages.
- Display data from various sources, including JSON, CSV, and SQLite databases.
- Handle dynamic content and user inputs in web applications.

## What to Expect
This project guides you in building a Flask application that serves web pages using server-side rendering techniques. You'll start by creating basic templates, progressively adding dynamic content from multiple data sources. By the end, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of SSR, templating, and the skills to build efficient, scalable web applications.

## Project Structure
1. **Task 0 - Simple Templating Program**
   - Create a Python function to generate personalized invitation files from a template with placeholders and data objects.
   - Learn about string templating in Python and handle various edge cases.

2. **Task 1 - Basic HTML Template with Flask**
   - Set up a Flask application that serves a web page using a Jinja template.
   - Create a simple HTML page with reusable components like headers and footers.

3. **Task 2 - Dynamic Template with Loops and Conditions**
   - Enhance the Flask app by adding dynamic content using Jinja loops and conditions.
   - Read a list of items from a JSON file and display them dynamically.

4. **Task 3 - Displaying Data from JSON or CSV Files**
   - Build functionality to read and display product data from JSON and CSV files, with query parameters to filter by ID.
   - Implement error handling for invalid inputs and missing data.

5. **Task 4 - Extending Dynamic Data Display with SQLite**
   - Add SQLite database functionality, allowing users to choose JSON, CSV, or SQL as data sources.
   - Handle database-related errors and query parameters for filtering data.
